Dan and Boi tried recreating the Apple website!

It is looking fine on 1024x / 768x / 390x 

We had a good time working together, merging and working on our merge conflicts.
Unfortunately Apple changed their website while we were in the process of recreating its appearance so it will not be the same content as on their website.
